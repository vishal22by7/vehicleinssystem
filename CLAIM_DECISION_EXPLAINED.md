## What Happens When You Submit a Claim?

## 📊 Understanding "Severity" (Damage Level)

**Severity** is a number from 0 to 100 that tells us how badly your vehicle is damaged:

- **0-25% Severity** = **Minor Damage**
  - Examples: Small scratches, dents, broken mirrors, cracked headlights
  - Like: A small dent on the door, scratched bumper
  - **Cost to repair**: Usually ₹5,000 - ₹50,000

- **26-60% Severity** = **Moderate Damage**
  - Examples: Multiple dents, broken windows, damaged panels, bumper replacement
  - Like: Side panel damage, multiple scratches, broken lights
  - **Cost to repair**: Usually ₹50,000 - ₹2,00,000

- **61-100% Severity** = **Major/Total Damage**
  - Examples: Engine damage, structural damage, airbag deployment, frame damage
  - Like: Car flipped, major accident, engine failure
  - **Cost to repair**: Usually ₹2,00,000+ or vehicle may be "totaled" (beyond repair)

   - AI is not very sure about the damage
   - Photos might be unclear or damage is hard to assess

3. **Critical Parts Damaged**
   - Engine, transmission, chassis, airbag, brakes
   - These need expert inspection
   - **Example**: "Engine making strange noise after accident"

   - Needs review to check for fraud

5. **High-Value Claim** (> ₹2,00,000)

## ❌ REJECTED (No Payment)

**When:** Your claim is rejected and you won't get any money

**IMPORTANT:** Rejection does NOT mean your vehicle is completely damaged! It means the claim doesn't meet the insurance criteria.

**Conditions for Rejection:**

1. **Major Damage** (Severity ≥ 60%)
   - Very severe damage
   - May indicate total loss or very expensive repairs
   - **Example**: "Car flipped, frame bent, engine damaged"

2. **Policy Issues**
   - Policy expired or inactive
   - Policy doesn't cover this type of damage
   - **Example**: "You claimed for engine damage but your policy doesn't cover engine"

3. **Fraud Indicators**
   - Suspicious patterns (too many claims)
   - Inconsistent information
   - **Example**: "5 claims in 6 months - suspicious activity"

4. **Invalid Claim**
   - Not a valid vehicle image
   - Damage not covered by policy
   - **Example**: "Photo shows a bicycle, not your insured vehicle"

5. **Very High Claim Frequency** (4+ claims in last year)
   - Too many claims in short time
   - Indicates possible fraud

**What "Rejected" Means:**
- ❌ **No payment** will be made for this claim
- ❌ **You pay** for repairs yourself
- ❌ **But your vehicle might still be repairable** (just not covered by insurance)

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Major Damage Rejection**
- Your car was in a major accident
- Severity: 85% (very severe damage)
- **Result**: ❌ Rejected - Damage too severe, may be total loss
- **What it means**: Insurance won't pay, but your car might still be repairable (you'd pay yourself)

**Scenario 2: Policy Issue Rejection**
- Your policy expired last month
- You submit a claim
- **Result**: ❌ Rejected - Policy not active
- **What it means**: No coverage because policy expired

**Scenario 3: Fraud Rejection**
- You've made 6 claims in the last year
- All for similar minor damages
- **Result**: ❌ Rejected - Suspicious claim pattern
- **What it means**: Too many claims, possible fraud

## 💰 How Much Money Do You Get?

### If Your Claim is **APPROVED**:

**Payout Calculation:**
- **Low Severity** (< 40%): 10-30% of your policy premium
  - Example: Premium ₹10,000 → Payout ₹1,000 - ₹3,000
  
- **Medium Severity** (40-60%): 30-60% of your policy premium
  - Example: Premium ₹10,000 → Payout ₹3,000 - ₹6,000
  
- **High Severity** (60%+): 60-90% of your policy premium
  - Example: Premium ₹10,000 → Payout ₹6,000 - ₹9,000

**Note:** Payout is based on your policy premium, not the actual repair cost. This is standard insurance practice.

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q1: If my claim is rejected, does it mean my car is completely destroyed?
**A:** No! Rejection means insurance won't pay, not that your car is destroyed. Your car might still be repairable, but you'd pay for repairs yourself.

### Q2: Can I appeal a rejected claim?
**A:** Yes! You can contact the Claims Review Committee to appeal. All rejections go through committee review (IRDAI requirement).

### Q3: Why do I get less money than repair cost?
**A:** Insurance payout is based on your policy premium and damage severity, not actual repair cost. This is standard practice.

### Q4: What if AI makes a mistake?
**A:** That's why we have manual review! If AI confidence is low or damage is moderate, a human expert reviews it.

### Q5: How long does it take?
**A:** 
- Auto-Approved: Hours
- Manual Review: 1-3 days
- Rejected: Usually within 24 hours
